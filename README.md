CTF-Outside
-----------

This is a Quake port of the Unreal Tournament 4 map CTF-Outside, which was the prototype for the final map CTF-Titanpass. The map is intended to be played with the [KTX](https://github.com/QW-Group/ktx) setting `k_ctf_based_spawn` set to `1`, and might perhaps be even more interesting without hook enabled.

Porting
-------

The port was made manually brush by brush without any form of automation and is thus not identical to CTF-Outside, neither geometry nor textures, but fairly close.
